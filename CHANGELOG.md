# Fuse Sublime package 1.2.2
This update offers a minor (but useful) addition to UX completion, and reflects the recent changes in the tool where automatic reload of source files makes manual refresh obsolete.

## New features
* UX attribute completion now appends ="" to attributes when completing and moves your caret for you
* Added shortcut for build-and-run (Win: F7, Mac: Cmd + E)
* Refresh has been deprecated in favor of recompile (Win: F6, Mac: shift + Cmd + r)

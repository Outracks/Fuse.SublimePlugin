Sublime Plugin
==================
Sublime plugin for Fuse Editor

How to install on Windows
=================
Go to AppData/Roaming (Type %appdata% in file explorer). Find the "Sublime Text 3" folder, and go into "Packages".
Clone repo into this folder, and RENAME the folder to "Fuse", and restart sublime if it's already open.

Also if you have set the default syntax language for .uno and .ux files before, you must set these again. Set .uno to Fuse/Uno and .ux to Fuse/UX.

This is a temporary install solution. There will be an eaiser way of doing this in the future.
